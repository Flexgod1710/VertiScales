Overview
VertiScales is a Java-based simulation project designed to model the probability of a sick person going to the office. The project leverages complex algorithms and probabilistic models to simulate various scenarios and outcomes, providing valuable insights into the behavior and decision-making processes in workplace attendance.

Features
Advanced Simulation Algorithms: Implements sophisticated algorithms to model attendance probabilities.
Customizable Parameters: Allows users to adjust parameters and variables for tailored simulations.
Detailed Reporting: Generates comprehensive reports and visualizations of simulation results.
Installation
To get started with VertiScales, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/Flexgod1710/VertiScales.git

Navigate to the Project Directory: cd VertiScales

Set Up the Project: Ensure you have Java JDK installed. You can build the project using your preferred IDE or via the command line.

Build the Project: If using Maven: mvn clean install Or if using Gradle: gradle build

Usage
To run the simulation, use the following command: java -cp target/VertiScales-1.0.jar com.vertiscales.Main

Replace com.vertiscales.Main with the appropriate main class if it's different.

Configuration
Simulation Parameters: Edit the config.properties file to adjust simulation parameters such as probability rates, office days, etc.
